# Portfolio

In my portfolio you will find placeholders for projects I will soon be completing. For now, I put some pictures and placeholder text, along with a placeholder biography. As the time passes I will add more to this page so as to develop a complete example of my work to give employers. This is my first webpage I have built from scratch and is an important and exciting benchmark on my journey to become a web developer.
